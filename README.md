# House Prices Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models such as **Random Forests** and **Decision Trees**.  
The implementation is done in Jupyter Notebook and leverages Python libraries for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── HousePrice.ipynb   # Main Jupyter notebook containing the workflow
├── data/              # Folder containing datasets
```

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training using:
  - Random Forests  
  - Decision Trees  
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics  

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:

- numpy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `HousePrice.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder.  
Ensure the notebook has access to the dataset before running.

## Results

- The notebook demonstrates training and evaluation of different models.  
- Random Forest generally provides strong predictive performance for house prices.
